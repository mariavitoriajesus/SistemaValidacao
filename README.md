Desafio de projeto: Criando Um Pequeno Sistema Para Validação de Processo Seletivo
## Cases

### Case 1

Imagine a scenario where, in a selection process, there is a base salary value of R$2,000.00 and the salary desired by the candidate. Developing flow control where:

- If the base salary value is higher than the desired salary, print: CALL THE CANDIDATE;
- Otherwise, if the base salary value is equal to the desired salary value, print: CALL THE CANDIDATE WITH A COUNTERPROPOSAL;
 Otherwise, print: WAITING FOR RESULTS FROM OTHER CANDIDATES.

### Case 2

A system was requested that ensures that, given the countless applications, only a maximum of five candidates are selected for the interview where the desired salary is less than or equal to the base salary.

### Case 3

Now print the list of selected candidates to make it available for HR to contact.

### Case 4

HR must make a call with a maximum of 03 attempts for each selected candidate, and if the candidate answers, they must print:

- WE MANAGED TO CONTACT [CANDIDATE] AFTER [ATTEMPTS].
- Otherwise, print: “WE CANNOT CONTACT THE [CANDIDATE]”
